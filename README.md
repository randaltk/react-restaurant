# react-restaurant

Welcome to React Restaurant!

This is the repository for the react-restaurant application, which contains a VITE + TS frontend hosted on Netlify and a BFF integrating the  restaurants yelp request with an AWS Lambda/Api Gateway from AWS.
I chose this option to solve the CORS problem and have the application available in production.

Frontend URL: https://react-restaurant-net.netlify.app/

BFF URL ( GET ): https://41otwa6n9a.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/get-integration

To run the project, you will need to clone it and run a npm install command followed by npm run dev on the react-restaurant frontend application
